### Important

- investigate a better way to launch pdflatex externally (not halting on error, or strictly reproducing the command-line interaction in the interface)

### Optional

- refresh while keeping the structure of the tree
- better CX on error handling
- visual hint for the selected template
- autocompletion
- reload templates dynamically (possibly indexing them to make it faster)
